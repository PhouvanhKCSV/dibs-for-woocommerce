DIBS for WooCommerce is a plugin that extends WooCommerce, allowing you to take payments via DIBS (via the D2/FlexWin platform).



== DESCRIPTION ==
DIBS Payment Services is a leading Scandinavian online payment service provider. DIBS can take payment in the following currencies: Danish Krona - Euro - US Dollar $ - English Pound Â£ - Swedish Krona - Australian Dollar - Canadian Dollar - Icelandic Krona - Japanese Yen - New Zealand Dollar - Norwegian Krona - Swiss Franc - Turkish Lire.

To get started with DIBS you will need an agreement with DIBS as well as your acquiring bank. Visit [DIBS](http://www.dibspayment.com/) website for more information.

When the order goes through, the user is taken to DIBS to make a secure payment. No SSL certificate is required on your site (even though it's strongly recommended). After payment the user is taken back to your thank you page.

More information on how to get started can be found in the [plugin documentation](http://docs.krokedil.com/documentation/dibs-for-woocommerce/).
