To get started with DIBS you will need an agreement with DIBS as well as a redemption agreement with your bank. For more information about payment methods see http://www.dibspayment.com/products/internet/payment_methods/.

When the order goes through, the user is taken to DIBS to make a secure payment. No SSL certificate is required on your site. After payment the user is taken back to your thank you page.

This plugin extends WooCommerce with a DIBS payment gateway. The plugin will only work if WooCommerce is activated.
